# Bootstrapping-parametric-models-of-mortality
Models to describe a mortality structure are widely used in actuarial mathematics. These models are often limited to the mortality structure of clearly defined groups (e.g. the mortality structure of men up to 90 years of age in the USA). In order to depict these realistically, the parameters of the models must be estimated as accurately as possible. This results in high demands on the database from which the assumptions about the parameters are made. The data must have a high degree of consistency as well as representativeness and a high scope, so that the uncertainties of the parameter estimation are minimized. One method to artificially increase the quantitative extent of the database and thus to perform more accurate parameter estimates is the bootstrap method. In the following, this procedure is exemplarily performed on a database to estimate the parameters of a survival function.
